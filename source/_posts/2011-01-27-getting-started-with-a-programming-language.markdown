Hello, and welcome to a blog series about programming languages. The goal is to explain how to get started in a few quick steps : install, write a simple test, write a simple program. Hopefully, just enough information to get you started without getting in your way.

I recommend you try your chops with <a href="http://projecteuler.net" target="_blank">http://projecteuler.net</a> - fun algorithm implementation. A good way to learn a programming language.

When talking to people, please remember <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" target="_blank">How to Ask Questions the Smart Way</a>.
