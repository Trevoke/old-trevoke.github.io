One can't actually move a remote branch, but you can copy a branch and delete a branch, so...

Copy oldbranch in repo to newbranch.
[code]git push {repo} {oldbranch}:heads/{newbranch}[/code]
Ex: git push origin foobranch:barbranch
renames foobranch to barbranch

Remove a remote branch: itâ€™s all about the colon:

[code]git push &lt;remote_repo&gt; :heads/&lt;branch&gt;[/code]

Example: git push origin :heads/some-branch removes some-branch from the remote repo (apparently git push origin :some-branch works as well).

This works for removing a tag as well: git push origin :sometag
