  content: I'm sorry if that came off as rude, it wasn't intended to be.  We don't
    have a timeframe, we never do.  Things are done when they are done, they are implemented
    when they're implemented.  We're working on the smart http stuff, and when it's
    done we'll make an announcement.  Hopefully that's soon, but it might be later.

    Thanks for the toned-down reply with the information I had asked for. I am constantly amazed that people hate saying "I don't know" so much that they'll do anything to avoid it (this isn't an attack on you, just a general statement, although your behavior does seem to fit the description).
    Anyway - I do appreciate it; thanks. I hope you all manage to implement it soon. Github is a great service and, from what I've read, a great company made of great people.
    Take care!

  content: Honestly it's not really a matter of being afraid to say we don't have
    a date... we never have deadlines and I'm very proud of that really.  I just get
    sick of saying the exact same thing over and over again, it makes me feel like
    one of those tech support drones at any old company.  So I try to mix things up
    a bit.

I will readily admit that I don't know all that much about Github or Git for that matter. I use them, they're handy, and that's where it stops. I read about a git feature called "smart HTTP", which would allow to communicate both ways with git (push and pull) with HTTP or HTTPS. So, I asked Github about it - it would be nice for them to have this feature, because I currently can't push to Github from work. Here's how the exchange went.
(this first message is from memory, as I used the web interface, so I don't have a copy of it)
<strong>Me:</strong> <em>
Hi, I just read about this: http://progit.org/2010/03/04/smart-http.html and I would like to know when Github plans on implementing this, because it would be very useful.

You do know that Scott (the guy who wrote Pro Git) works for us, right?  We're well
aware of smart http...<em>

</em><em>I tried to make light of the condescending tone and sent the following reply:</em>
<strong>Me: </strong>
Nope.. Had no idea.
So when will it be implemented? ;)

It will be implemented when it is...

That's when I just gave up. I don't know if whoever handles the messages is paid or not, but I'm pretty sure Github pays its employees by now. I'm using a free account, so they wouldn't lose anything by me leaving them, and they do provide a great service.
Am I just being picky when I expect the support staff to be polite? I say this as someone who has worked as support staff for over three years: no. The support staff SHOULD, nay, MUST be polite. I don't care how flat your company hierarchy is, I don't care how young or forward-thinking the company is, and I especially don't care if your target audience is Asperger's syndrome-suffering programmers who laugh at Star Trek jokes and read slash fiction. You're the support, you're polite. Especially over a medium like text, where you can't easily place a slap on the shoulder, a grin and a wink.

This has left a bad taste in my mouth.
