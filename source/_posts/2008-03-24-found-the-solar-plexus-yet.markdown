We have a move in a form that requires holding a hand in front of the solar plexus. One of the kids was holding his hand a little low, so I mentioned it to him.. He start hitting his chest a few times with his hand, so I laugh. "Think you got it?" He does it a few more times and starts coughing. "Ah, now you got it."
