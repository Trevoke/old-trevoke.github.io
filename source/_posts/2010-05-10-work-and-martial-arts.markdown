Funny how, when I'm busy, I stop updating this blog, isn't it.

I'm learning a good amount on HTTP, Perl (specifically CGI) and working on using TDD with Ruby/Rails: it's a mindset.

Regarding martial arts, sensei helped me figure out that my punches are all wrong, and the issue has been traced to lower back muscles. Thankfully, I've got tons of subway time now, so I can practice standing. For those of you who don't study martial arts... That last sentence is not a joke.

On an unrelated note: I always enjoy the fact that 'martial arts' is commonly mistyped as 'marital arts'. I knew the two were similar (*grin*), but some sentences are downright hilarious.
