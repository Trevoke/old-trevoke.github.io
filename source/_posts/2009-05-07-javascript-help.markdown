I want to have a variable number of text fields in a form, and sending all of these text fields to one function when it is submitted. My best guess is that they'd have to be passed in as an array, unless there's a more elegant solution (akin to ARGV in Ruby, or the arguments passed in to a program that starts.. ?).

Does anybody have an idea?
