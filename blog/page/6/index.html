I&rsquo;ve implemented some <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> testing, the code now <em>actually</em> parses SGF files properly, including the KGS ones, it&rsquo;ll work on Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.1, so .. It&rsquo;s all good on that front.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am watching Rocky III and IV (the only ones I really like), and the driving theme is the power of the human spirit. Rewatching it now, I see a lot of other ideas. They&rsquo;re not particularly hidden, but I never really noticed them before. This started to make me think about my choices.
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-163"></a>
My lasting decision to study martial arts was made in college, and I took a Physical Education class of self-defense taught by shifu Christopher Goedecke, who studies and teaches isshin kempo. During the first class, we sat and he asked us why we chose to study martial arts. My answer was, &ldquo;I want to develop discipline over my mind and body.&rdquo;
I can tell you today that this answer was probably not the truth. It was probably what I thought shifu wanted to hear so he&rsquo;d think that I was special, or would be a good, dedicated student.
Why this behavior? Saying that everyone wants to be special would be a bit of a cop-out answer here. I always, always liked the idea of the martial arts, and the dedication, the Way.
A more refined thought is that I wanted a mentor. A senior figure I could respect, who could teach me and guide me. For all my mental independence and ambition, I want to be somebody&rsquo;s pupil.
When I was barely beginning, I had the self-centered thought that shifu Goedecke would instantly take a liking to me and take me under his wing. I was, what, 20 years old or so? Most of my thoughts back then were self-centered. For that matter, most of them now are, too.</p>

<p>I graduated, and shifu Goedecke told me it was silly to drive two hours each way for a class, that I should find a teacher closer to me, and that we&rsquo;d see what the future brought. I dutifully did so, and found sensei Marilyn Fierro, who teaches and studies isshinryu karate. I&rsquo;ll skip all the martial arts lineage drama. Isshin kempo and isshinryu karate have close ties, so I found the same kata (forms), and I did not have to relearn everything from scratch.</p>

<p>I joined the dojo and studied for a few years with no questions, no doubts. I reached the rank of first degree black belt, and kept on studying. As I near the exam for second degree black belt, questions appear. The timing, as far as belt tests, is possibly coincidental. As the rest of life happened around me and to me, and as I looked at my behavior, and how I felt about things.. Questions appeared. As my view of the world becomes less self-centered &ndash; as the world grows beyond my belly button and encompasses others, and as I become aware more fully of other people, I see how I relate to other people.</p>

<p>So.. Why do I study martial arts? In a world and a society where fighters are a specific group of people, and the average person doesn&rsquo;t fight, why? In a world where a living is made from the product of thoughts.. Why a physical discipline? What is the point?
I always believed in a society, or a social circle, or at least people who would accept and respect each other based on a similar culture, mindset, and skillset. I see this happen in the hacker/programmer culture and in the martial arts culture. This being said, I&rsquo;m only talking about martial arts here.
So, I want to just be me and my skills, and not be respected for some other reason. And someday, I believe it&rsquo;ll happen. It&rsquo;s a long way up, but that&rsquo;s the point &ndash; that skill cannot be faked.</p>

<p>So now, we come to a major doubt of mine, something that&rsquo;s been nurtured for a while and which is the ghost I now need to face.
As an introduction, we have the Rocky movies, and there&rsquo;s a manga called &lsquo;The Breaker&rsquo; which I am reading, as recommended by a friend of mine. That manga talks about a kid who apparently has no physical skill, no innate ki, but develops tremendous spirit, determination, mental resistance, and learns through that. At the point where I am in the movie, he fights a kid who is a super-genius of the martial arts, has mastered five at the age of fifteen, has amazing amounts of ki and physical prowess, and is essentially perfect &ndash; but he relies on logic and doesn&rsquo;t really understand the power of sheer spirit.</p>

<p>Well. As the second degree exam approaches&hellip; Slowly but surely, my training has become a little more intense, and I have felt things become more difficult. And I don&rsquo;t like it. I do it, but I don&rsquo;t like it. I am naturally a lazy person, and I want to change that. I just don&rsquo;t put in that much effort. I rely on the fact that I am naturally &lsquo;good enough&rsquo;. I want to change that. I want to push myself further. But where&rsquo;s my spirit? My will to not stop when it hurts? I&rsquo;ve always lacked that. Oh &ndash; I don&rsquo;t mean that I am a wuss, but &hellip; I doubt myself.</p>

<p>There has been improvement. I will not deny it. I have seen myself improve. I can stretch further than I used to, more than I used to.. I can do more push-ups, my stamina&rsquo;s improved. I can do more.. But it&rsquo;s not enough. I need to be more. More. More. Always more.</p>

<p>I get the feeling I&rsquo;m reaching my limit. And this feeling has to be a mental block, an illusion. It can&rsquo;t be real, but it seems so real. How do I get rid of this? Ugh. How do I convince myself that my limit is further away?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was surprisingly good. I didn&rsquo;t feel very good tonight &ndash; slight headache, slight tingle in the throat. I wasn&rsquo;t going to stay for my class, just help teach and then go home, get tea, get sleep.. But <a id="more"></a><a id="more-157"></a>only two other adults showed up and sensei was upstairs, so I started the class and took it easy on the calisthenics and the stretches. Those two adults are the two with the most issues of muscle contractions (as in, they have no idea what relaxing means). So I started off real, real easy, taking them back to the basics.
I spent the entire class putting no emphasis on heavy force (or rather, an emphasis on the lack of such). All I wanted was high chambers, and then high and with the correct angle, and then high + the correct angle + tight chambers, and then that plus the kicks. So it was five reps of just chambers, then the other side, then five reps of loose, relaxed chambers on the first side, then the same thing on the other side.
I did that on all the basic kicks, which took about 30 minutes. It was time very well spent, because I noticed marked improvement in both students as well as in my own body.
Sensei came down about halfway through and listened, then watched. She gave a few key corrections to the students and one to me, and then afterwards, she told me I&rsquo;d done a good thing! WOO HOO!</p>

<p>All in all, the light exercise gave me a light workout, keeping my body temperature up without exhausting me.. Now I&rsquo;m home, sipping Silver Needle tea in a &ldquo;Mug of vi&rdquo; from Thinkgeek. Life is good, right this moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So tonight, I went to train 35 minutes away from home, at the dojo where my sensei&rsquo;s sensei teaches. Warmups / stretches, kicking drills, calisthenics, sparring, then fighting drills.
Sensei&rsquo;s sensei has a son who is now 48. Now &mdash; I am fast by normal people&rsquo;s standards. This guy is really fast by my standards. He also has a really positive energy &ndash; very friendly eyes, a great disposition.. And he can dislocate your jaw before you can blink or think &ldquo;oh sh..!&rdquo;, so don&rsquo;t piss him off.
Anyway, as much as shihan (sensei&rsquo;s sensei) is amazing, tall, skilled, talented, dedicated to his art, as much his son inherited many of the traits, has been training under his dad a long time, and has learned a lot from a ton of sparring and tournaments and just .. being there.
So now he imparts his wisdom and skills, and it&rsquo;s WONDERFUL to watch him in action, and learn from him, and listen to his way of explaining things. Just like in Dune, &ldquo;A process cannot be understood by stopping it&rdquo;, he explains action and reaction within the context of a moving match, which is AWESOME.</p>

<p>I breathe hard when I&rsquo;m in this class. It&rsquo;s a bit of a work-out, and excellent cardio.
Oh ! So shihan&rsquo;s son hit me twice, and I managed to shift out of the way of the third strike, like I felt his movement and reacted. It was sweet. Now I only need to make that happen ALL THE TIME.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a good time in the dojo tonight. Managed to bring a kid back from the verge of tears to feeling good and performing kata with solid focus and intent.. And then good sparring. Kid&rsquo;s 6, by the way.
My class wasn&rsquo;t that good, though I got a compliment on my push-ups from sensei. Went through my kicks.. Then sparred..</p>

<p>I fleetingly get a grasp of efficient body movement, and then it disappears, and then I have to train a lot more to make it happen again, and then more again, etc etc, until I can make it happen effortlessly.</p>

<p>I really, really love teaching martial arts. There&rsquo;s something about the student-teacher relationship, in the study of something which involves both body and mind &ndash; and you can&rsquo;t lie or fake your way through that. It&rsquo;s all about the truth, and being naked and exposed. It forces you to examine yourself and your relationship with others.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I play weiqi (known as the game of go, but I prefer using the chinese name).
There are some SGF parsers out there for Ruby, but I wanted to write my own &ndash; the other ones didn&rsquo;t seem comprehensive enough, didn&rsquo;t seem Ruby-like enough in their objectifiying the <del datetime="2009-09-16T04:15:45+00:00">women</del> data.
My original goal was twofold: write a script to rename all the SGF files in my collection so they can be easily parsed later, and &hellip; Learn more Ruby!
Here is the github link: <a href="http://github.com/Trevoke/SGFParser">http://github.com/Trevoke/SGFParser</a>
It&rsquo;s a work in progress. Right now it parses the SGF file properly, but the user has a fair amount of work to do to use the data.. Which, maybe, is the way it needs to be. But I&rsquo;m gonna try to follow the principle of least surprise to the bitter end! :)</p>
