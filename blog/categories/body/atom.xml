    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So tonight, I went to train 35 minutes away from home, at the dojo where my sensei&rsquo;s sensei teaches. Warmups / stretches, kicking drills, calisthenics, sparring, then fighting drills.
Sensei&rsquo;s sensei has a son who is now 48. Now &mdash; I am fast by normal people&rsquo;s standards. This guy is really fast by my standards. He also has a really positive energy &ndash; very friendly eyes, a great disposition.. And he can dislocate your jaw before you can blink or think &ldquo;oh sh..!&rdquo;, so don&rsquo;t piss him off.
Anyway, as much as shihan (sensei&rsquo;s sensei) is amazing, tall, skilled, talented, dedicated to his art, as much his son inherited many of the traits, has been training under his dad a long time, and has learned a lot from a ton of sparring and tournaments and just .. being there.
So now he imparts his wisdom and skills, and it&rsquo;s WONDERFUL to watch him in action, and learn from him, and listen to his way of explaining things. Just like in Dune, &ldquo;A process cannot be understood by stopping it&rdquo;, he explains action and reaction within the context of a moving match, which is AWESOME.</p>

<p>I breathe hard when I&rsquo;m in this class. It&rsquo;s a bit of a work-out, and excellent cardio.
Oh ! So shihan&rsquo;s son hit me twice, and I managed to shift out of the way of the third strike, like I felt his movement and reacted. It was sweet. Now I only need to make that happen ALL THE TIME.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I live on an island. It only took me until last week (10 years and change) to take my dad&rsquo;s advice to go to the beach when I felt like it. So I did that, last week and today, and went swimming. Good for the muscles, good all-around body work. Great stretching. Different way of using the muscles.</p>

<p>Besides the fact that I could really only swim for 10-15 minutes before I was tired and a part of my arms started to ache (indicating, clearly, that I&rsquo;d been ignoring it), I noticed on my way home that even just 30 minutes at the beach drained me of energy. The &lsquo;new&rsquo; situation was interesting, I was very aware of everything, and I spent a lot of energy on focus which did not need to be spent. It&rsquo;ll be a learning curve. It&rsquo;s a shame autumn is upon us.</p>

<p>On another note, I am finding sand in my hair, and am reminded of my childhood. It is a good feeling.</p>
